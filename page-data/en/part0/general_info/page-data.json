The main focus is on single-page applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful and GraphQL web services implemented with Node.js. The course also has parts on TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous integration.</p>\n<p>Other topics include debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases.</p>\n<p>The course is totally free of charge. You can get a certificate and even the University of Helsinki ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) credits for free.</p>\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and know the basics of the Git version control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and a capacity for solving problems and seeking information independently</p>\n<p>Previous knowledge of JavaScript or other course topics is not required.</p>\n<p>How much programming experience is needed? It is hard to say, but you should be pretty fluent in <em>your</em> language. This level of fluency takes usually at least 100-200 hours of practice to develop.</p>\n<h3>Course material</h3>\n<p>The course material is meant to be read one part at a time and in order.</p>\n<p>The material contains exercises, which are placed so that the preceding material provides enough information for solving each exercise. You can do the exercises as you encounter them in the material, but it can also be beneficial to read all of the material in the part before starting with the exercises.</p>\n<p>In many parts of the course, the exercises build one larger application one small piece at a time. Some of the exercise applications are developed through multiple parts.</p>\n<p>The course material is based on incrementally expanding example applications, which change from part to part. It's best to follow the code along while making small modifications independently. The code of the example applications for each step of each part can be found on GitHub.</p>\n<h3>Taking the course</h3>\n<p>The course contains fourteen parts, the first of which is numbered 0 for consistency with past iterations. One part corresponds loosely to one week (averaging 15-20 hours) of studying, but the speed of completing the course is flexible.</p>\n<p>Proceeding from part <em>n</em> to part <em>n+1</em> is not sensible before enough know-how of the topics in part <em>n</em> has been achieved. In pedagogic terms, the course uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning\">Mastery Learning</a>, and you are only intended to proceed to the next part after doing enough of the exercises of the previous part.</p>\n<p>In parts 1-4 you are expected to do at least <strong>all</strong> of the exercises that are <strong>not</strong> marked with an asterisk(*). Exercises marked with an asterisk count towards your final grade, but skipping them does not prevent you from doing the compulsory exercises in the next parts. Parts 5-13 do not have asterisk-marked exercises since there is no similar dependency on previous parts.</p>\n<p>The speed of completing the course is flexible.</p>\n<p>Exercise completion time statistics can be found via the <a href=\"https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen\">submission system</a>.</p>\n<h3>Course channel in Discord</h3>\n<p>You can discuss the course and related topics in our dedicated group on Discord <a href=\"https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/fullstack\">https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/fullstack</a>. Discord has fullstack_general and part-specific (channel names with fullstack prefix) channels for course-related discussion. Note that Discord's <em>chat channel is not suitable for course-related discussions</em>. Please join the conversation!</p>\n<h3>How to get help in Discord</h3>\n<p>When you ask for help for a problem in the Discord group your question should be as informative and precise as possible. If your question looks like this</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Adding a new person does not work, could you help me with that?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>it is quite likely that nobody will respond. The bug can be <em>anywhere</em>.</p>\n<p>A better question could be</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>In exercise 2.15 when I try to add a new person to the app, the server responds with a 403, despite the request looking ok to me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The code looks like this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">  <span class=\"token comment\">// the relevant part of code is pasted here</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// code should contain several console.log statements for helping the debugging</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The following gets printed to the console</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">  // data printed to console</code></pre></div>\n<p>The network tab looks like the following*</p>\n<p>[screenshot from the network console]</p>\n<p>All the code can be found here (a link to GitHub)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Parts and completion</h3>\n<p>Full Stack studies consist of the core course and multiple extensions. You can complete the studies in the extent of 5 to 14 credits.</p>\n<h4>Parts 0-5 (core course) - Full Stack Web Development (5 cr, CSM141081)</h4>\n<p>The number of credits and the grade for the course are based on the total number of submitted exercises for parts 0-7 (including exercises marked with an asterisk).</p>\n<p>Credits and grades are calculated as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>exercises</th>\n<th align=\"center\">credits</th>\n<th align=\"center\">grade</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>138</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>127</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>116</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>105</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>94</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>83</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>72</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Once you have completed enough exercises for a passing grade, you can download the course certificate from the <a href=\"https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen\">submission system</a>.</p>\n<p>If you wish to receive university credits, you must complete the course exam. The exam does not count toward your final grade, but you must pass it. More information about the exam <a href=\"/en/part0/general_info#the-course-exam\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You can only take the exam after submitting enough exercises for five credits. It is not wise in practice to take the exam immediately after submitting the critical number of exercises. The exam is the same for 5-14 credits and does not count toward your grade.</p>\n<p><em>You do not need to attend the course exam or register for the Open University course to obtain the course certificate.</em></p>\n<h4>Part 6 - Full Stack Web Development, extension 1 (1 cr, CSM141082)</h4>\n<p>By submitting at least 127 of the exercises for parts 0-7 while working on the core course, you can receive an additional credit through this extension.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit at least 127 exercises for parts 0-7.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avoin.helsinki.fi/palvelut/esittely.aspx?s=otm-abc0a702-3d35-496f-87b9-5c7845a9367b\">Enroll in part 6 through the Open University</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/part0/general_info/#how-to-get-your-credits\">Request credits for part 6</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Part 7 - Full Stack Web Development, extension 2 (1 cr, CSM141083)</h4>\n<p>By submitting at least 138 of the exercises for parts 0-7 while working on the core course, you can receive an additional credit through this extension.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit at least 138 exercises for parts 0-7.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.avoin.helsinki.fi/palvelut/esittely.aspx?s=otm-3149cc5e-8d83-4471-8eba-870093a2f01f\">Enroll in part 7 through the Open University</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/part0/general_info/#how-to-get-your-credits\">Request credits for part 7</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Part 8 - Full Stack Web Development: GraphQL (1 cr, CSM14113)</h4>\n<p>By submitting at least 22/26 of the exercises for part 8 of the course, GraphQL, you can get one additional credit.

You can of course create a new repository for each part. If you are using a private repository, add <em>mluukkai</em> as a collaborator.</p>\n<p>Exercises are submitted <strong>one part at a time</strong>. You will mark the number of exercises you have completed from that module. Once you have submitted exercises for a part, you can no longer submit any more exercises for that part.</p>\n<p>A system for detecting plagiarism is used to check exercises submitted to GitHub. If code is found from model answers or multiple students hand in the same code, the situation is handled according to the <a href=\"https://guide.student.helsinki.fi/en/article/what-cheating-and-plagiarism\">policy on plagiarism</a> of the University of Helsinki.</p>\n<p>Many of the exercises build a larger application bit by bit.

text</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>University credit registration in progress...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Please note</strong> that to get university credits you need a registration for each completed part. Please see <a href=\"/en/part0/general_info#parts-and-completion\">more information about registration</a>.</p>\n<p>You can view your grade in the University of Helsinki Sisu and <a href=\"https://opintopolku.fi/oma-opintopolku/\">Opintopolku</a> approximately four weeks after notifying us.</p>\n<p>When the registration is done, the following text appears in the submission system</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>University credits registered, see the course page for how to get a transcript if you need one</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Where do I get my University of Helsinki Student number</h3>\n<p>When and if you enroll in a course for the first time through the Open University, a University of Helsinki student number will be automatically generated. <strong>*Please make sure you have enrolled in the course before you try to find out what your student number is.</strong> *</p>\n<p>Note also that <strong>you do not need to enroll</strong> in Open University to get the course certificate!</p>\n<p>You can find out what your student number is through one of the options below:</p>\n<h4>A) Sisu</h4>\n<p>If you have a University of Helsinki user account, you can find your student number from your profile in the University of Helsinki’s study information system Sisu:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to Sisu with your University of Helsinki username and password.</li>\n<li>Select: My profile</li>\n<li>Select: Personal information</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>B) Enrollment confirmation email</h4>\n<p>After course enrollment, you will receive a confirmation email to an email address you have entered on the enrollment form.

You can order a transcript using the student services <a href=\"https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/132797/lomake.html?rinnakkaislomake=Rinnakkaislomake1_en%5Bk%5D\">e-form</a>. </p>\n<p>An electronic transcript of studies will be delivered to you by email. Present this document at your institution to have the credits included in your degree. The decision to include the credits will be made by your home institution.</p>\n<h3>No more yearly versions</h3>\n<p>There are no more \"yearly versions\" of the course, the course is open all the time. Each part is updated once or twice per year. Updates are mostly minor: library versions are updated and text clarity is improved. However, there might also be some bigger changes.</p>\n<p>Despite changes <em>all the submitted exercises remain valid</em>, and the course can be continued without being bothered about updates. Also, the policy for getting certificates, university credits etc. shall remain the same no matter what happens.</p>\n<p>Recent major changes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Part 8: (3th January 2026) Apollo Server updated to v5.

If you wish to resubmit a whole part, please contact the course personnel via <a href=\"mailto:matti.luukkainen@helsinki.fi\">email</a> or Discord <em>mluukkai</em>, with your GitHub username and which parts you would like to have deleted from your submissions.</p>\n<h4>Expanding on the University of Helsinki instance of this course</h4>\n<p>That is also possible, just contact the course personnel via <a href=\"mailto:matti.luukkainen@helsinki.fi\">email</a> or Discord <em>mluukkai</em>.</p>\n<h3>Full stack project</h3>\n<p>A full stack project worth 5, 7 or 10 credits will be available through Open University.</p>\n<p>For the project, an application is implemented in React and/or Node, though implementing a mobile application in React Native is also possible.</p>\n<p>The number of credits is based on hours of work done. One credit is approximately 17.5 hours of work. The work is graded pass/fail.</p>\n<p>It is possible to complete the project as a pair or a group.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/misc/blob/master/project.md\">more information on the project</a>.</p>\n<h3>Interview promise</h3>\n<p>Our collaborators, <a href=\"https://houston-inc.com/\">Houston Inc.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.terveystalo.com/en/\">Terveystalo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smartly.io/\">Smartly.io</a>, have given the <em>promise of a job interview</em> for everyone who completes the course and the project work with maximum credits (14 + 10).</p>\n<p>This means that the student can, if they so choose to, sign up for a job interview with a collaborator who has given the promise. The teacher of the course, Matti Luukkainen, will send instructions to the student after the courses have been completed with maximum credits.</p>\n<p>You need to be a resident of Finland to participate in these interviews.</p>\n<h3>Before you start</h3>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome browser</a> is recommended for this course because it provides the best tools for web development. Another alternative is the <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/\">Developer Edition of Firefox</a>, which provides the same range of features.</p>\n<p>The course exercises are submitted to GitHub, so Git must be installed and you should know how to use it. For instructions, see <a href=\"https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners\">Git and GitHub tutorial for beginners</a>.</p>\n<p>Install a sensible text editor that supports web development. <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> is highly recommended.</p>\n<p>Don't code with nano, Notepad or Gedit. NetBeans isn't very good for web development either. It is also rather heavy in comparison to <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, install <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a>. The material is being updated to Node version v22. Parts 0-6 and 8 are made using Node version 22, part 10 using version 20.11.0, and the remaining parts using version 18.13.0. Always use at least as recent a Node version. Installation instructions can be found on the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\">Node.js website</a>.</p>\n<p>Node package manager <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm\">npm</a> will be automatically installed with Node.js. We will be actively using npm throughout the course. Node also comes with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx\">npx</a>, which we'll need a few times.</p>\n<h3>Typos in the material</h3>\n<p>If you find a typo in the material, or something has been expressed unclearly or is simply bad grammar, submit a <em>pull request</em> to the course material in the <a href=\"https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/fullstack-hy2020.github.io\">repository</a>. For example, the markdown source code of this page can be found in the repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/fullstack-hy2020.github.io/edit/source/src/content/0/en/part0a.md\">https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/fullstack-hy2020.github.io/edit/source/src/content/0/en/part0a.md</a></p>\n<p>At the bottom of each part of the material is a link to <em>propose changes to the material</em>. You can edit the source code of the page by clicking on the link.</p>\n<p>There are also lots of links in the material for many kinds of background material. If you notice that a link is broken (that happens too often...), propose a change or ping us in Discord if you do not find a replacement for the broken link.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"mainImage":{"publicURL":"/static/b9999ec785b2c3bc6b8d3ef5d3537538/part-0.svg"},"part":0,"letter":"a","lang":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"part":0,"letter":"a","lang":"en"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518"]}
