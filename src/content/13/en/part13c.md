### Migrations

Let's keep expanding the backend. We want to implement support for allowing users with <i>admin status</i> to put users of their choice in disabled mode, preventing them from logging in and creating new notes. In order to implement this, we need to add boolean fields to the users' database table indicating whether the user is an admin and whether the user is disabled.

We could proceed as before, i.e. change the model that defines the table and rely on Sequelize to synchronize the changes to the database. This is specified by these lines in the file <i>models/index.js</i>

```js
const Note = require('./note')
const User = require('./user')

Note.belongsTo(User)
User.hasMany(Note)

Note.sync({ alter: true }) // highlight-line
User.sync({ alter: true }) // highlight-line

module.exports = {
  Note, User
}
```

However, this approach does not make sense in the long run. Let's remove the lines that do the synchronization and move to using a much more robust way, [migrations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html) provided by Sequelize (and many other libraries).

In practice, a migration is a single JavaScript file that describes some modification to a database. A separate migration file is created for each single or multiple changes at once. Sequelize keeps a record of which migrations have been performed, i.e. which changes caused by the migrations are synchronized to the database schema. When creating new migrations, Sequelize keeps up to date on which changes to the database schema are yet to be made. In this way, changes are made in a controlled manner, with the program code stored in version control.

First, let's create a migration that initializes the database. The code for the migration is as follows

```js
const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize')

module.exports = {
  up: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('notes', {
      id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        primaryKey: true,
        autoIncrement: true
      },
      content: {
        type: DataTypes.TEXT,
        allowNull: false
      },
      important: {
        type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
        allowNull: false
      },
      date: {
        type: DataTypes.DATE
      },
    })
    await queryInterface.createTable('users', {
      id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        primaryKey: true,
        autoIncrement: true
      },
      username: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        unique: true,
        allowNull: false
      },
      name: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
        allowNull: false
      },
    })
    await queryInterface.addColumn('notes', 'user_id', {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      allowNull: false,
      references: { model: 'users', key: 'id' },
    })
  },
  down: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('notes')
    await queryInterface.dropTable('users')
  },
}
```

The migration file [defines](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html#migration-skeleton) the functions <i>up</i> and <i>down</i>, the first of which defines how the database should be modified when the migration is performed. The function <i>down</i> tells you how to undo the migration if there is a need to do so.

Our migration contains three operations, the first creates a <i>notes</i> table, the second creates a <i>users</i> table and the third adds a foreign key to the <i>notes</i> table referencing the creator of the note. Changes in the schema are defined by calling the [queryInterface](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/query-interface.html) object methods.

When defining migrations, it is essential to remember that unlike models, column and table names are written in snake case form:

```js
await queryInterface.addColumn('notes', 'user_id', { // highlight-line
  type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
  allowNull: false,
  references: { model: 'users', key: 'id' },
})
```

So in migrations, the names of the tables and columns are written exactly as they appear in the database, while models use Sequelize's default camelCase naming convention.

Save the migration code in the file <i>migrations/20211209\_00\_initialize\_notes\_and\_users.js</i>. Migration file names should always be named alphabetically when created so that previous changes are always before newer changes. One good way to achieve this order is to start the migration file name with the date and a sequence number.

We could run the migrations from the command line using the [Sequelize command line tool](https://github.com/sequelize/cli). However, we choose to perform the migrations manually from the program code using the [Umzug](https://github.com/sequelize/umzug) library. Let's install the library

```js
npm install umzug
```

Let's change the file <i>util/db.js</i> that handles the connection to the database as follows:

```js
const Sequelize = require('sequelize')
const { DATABASE_URL } = require('./config')
const { Umzug, SequelizeStorage } = require('umzug') // highlight-line

const sequelize = new Sequelize(DATABASE_URL)

// highlight-start
const runMigrations = async () => {
  const migrator = new Umzug({
    migrations: {
      glob: 'migrations/*.js',
    },
    storage: new SequelizeStorage({ sequelize, tableName: 'migrations' }),
    context: sequelize.getQueryInterface(),
    logger: console,
  })
  
  const migrations = await migrator.up()

  console.log('Migrations up to date', {
    files: migrations.map((mig) => mig.name),
  })
}
// highlight-end

const connectToDatabase = async () => {
  try {
    await sequelize.authenticate()
    /*  highlight-start */
    await runMigrations()
    /* highlight-end */
    console.log('connected to the database')
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('failed to connect to the database')
    console.log(err)
    return process.exit(1)
  }

  return null
}

module.exports = { connectToDatabase, sequelize }
```

The <i>runMigrations</i> function that performs migrations is now executed every time the application opens a database connection when it starts. Sequelize keeps track of which migrations have already been completed, so if there are no new migrations, running the <i>runMigrations</i> function does nothing.

Now let's start with a clean slate and remove all existing database tables from the application:

```sql
username => drop table notes;
username => drop table users;
username => \d
Did not find any relations.
```

Let's start up the application. A message about the migrations status is printed on the log

```bash
INSERT INTO "migrations" ("name") VALUES ($1) RETURNING "name";
Migrations up to date { files: [ '20211209_00_initialize_notes_and_users.js' ] }
database connected
```

If we restart the application, the log also shows that the migration was not repeated.

The database schema of the application now looks like this

```sql
postgres=# \d
                 List of relations
 Schema |     Name     |   Type   |     Owner
--------+--------------+----------+----------------
 public | migrations   | table    | username
 public | notes        | table    | username
 public | notes_id_seq | sequence | username
 public | users        | table    | username
 public | users_id_seq | sequence | username
```

So Sequelize has created a <i>migrations</i> table that allows it to keep track of the migrations that have been performed. The contents of the table look as follows:

```js
postgres=# select * from migrations;
                   name
-------------------------------------------
 20211209_00_initialize_notes_and_users.js
```

Let's create a few users in the database, as well as a set of notes, and after that we are ready to expand the application.

The current code for the application is in its entirety on [GitHub](https://github.com/fullstack-hy/part13-notes/tree/part13-6), branch <i>part13-6</i>.
### Admin user and user disabling

So we want to add two boolean fields to the <i>users</i> table
- _admin_ tells you whether the user is an admin
- _disabled_ tells you whether the user is disabled from actions

Let's create the migration that modifies the database in the file <i>migrations/20211209\_01\_admin\_and\_disabled\_to\_users.js</i>:

```js
const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize')

module.exports = {
  up: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.addColumn('users', 'admin', {
      type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
      defaultValue: false
    })
    await queryInterface.addColumn('users', 'disabled', {
      type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
      defaultValue: false
    })
  },
  down: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.removeColumn('users', 'admin')
    await queryInterface.removeColumn('users', 'disabled')
  },
}
```

Make corresponding changes to the model corresponding to the <i>users</i> table:

```js
User.init({
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true
  },
  username: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    unique: true,
    allowNull: false
  },
  name: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  },
  // highlight-start
  admin: {
    type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
    defaultValue: false
  },
  disabled: {
    type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN,
    defaultValue: false
  },
  // highlight-end
}, {
  sequelize,
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false,
  modelName: 'user'
})
```

When the new migration is performed when the code restarts, the schema is changed as desired:

```sql
username-> \d users
                                     Table "public.users"
  Column  |          Type          | Collation | Nullable |              Default
----------+------------------------+-----------+----------+-----------------------------------
 id       | integer                |           | not null | nextval('users_id_seq'::regclass)
 username | character varying(255) |           | not null |
 name     | character varying(255) |           | not null |
 admin    | boolean                |           |          |
 disabled | boolean                |           |          |
Indexes:
    "users_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
    "users_username_key" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (username)
Referenced by:
    TABLE "notes" CONSTRAINT "notes_user_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
```

Now let's expand the controllers as follows. We prevent logging in if the user field <i>disabled</i> is set to <i>true</i>:

```js
loginRouter.post('/', async (request, response) => {
  const body = request.body

  const user = await User.findOne({
    where: {
      username: body.username
    }
  })

  const passwordCorrect = body.password === 'secret'

  if (!(user && passwordCorrect)) {
    return response.status(401).json({
      error: 'invalid username or password'
    })
  }

// highlight-start
  if (user.disabled) {
    return response.status(401).json({
      error: 'account disabled, please contact admin'
    })
  }
  // highlight-end

  const userForToken = {
    username: user.username,
    id: user.id,
  }

  const token = jwt.sign(userForToken, process.env.SECRET)

  response
    .status(200)
    .send({ token, username: user.username, name: user.name })
})
```

Let's disable the user <i>jakousa</i> using his ID:

```sql
username => update users set disabled=true where id=3;
UPDATE 1
username => update users set admin=true where id=1;
UPDATE 1
username => select * from users;
 id | username |       name       | admin | disabled
----+----------+------------------+-------+----------
  2 | lynx     | Kalle Ilves      |       |
  3 | jakousa  | Jami Kousa       | f     | t
  1 | mluukkai | Matti Luukkainen | t     |
```

And make sure that logging in is no longer possible

![](../../images/13/2.png)

Let's create a route that will allow an admin to change the status of a user's account:

```js
const isAdmin = async (req, res, next) => {
  const user = await User.findByPk(req.decodedToken.id)
  if (!user.admin) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'operation not allowed' })
  }
  next()
}

router.put('/:username', tokenExtractor, isAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findOne({
    where: {
      username: req.params.username
    }
  })

  if (user) {
    user.disabled = req.body.disabled
    await user.save()
    res.json(user)
  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```

There are two middleware used, the first called <i>tokenExtractor</i> is the same as the one used by the note-creation route, i.e. it places the decoded token in the <i>decodedToken</i> field of the request-object. The second middleware <i>isAdmin</i> checks whether the user is an admin and if not, the request status is set to 401 and an appropriate error message is returned.

Note how <i>two middleware</i> are chained to the route, both of which are executed before the actual route handler. It is possible to chain an arbitrary number of middleware to a request.

The middleware <i>tokenExtractor</i> is now moved to <i>util/middleware.js</i> as it is used from multiple locations.

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')
const { SECRET } = require('./config.js')

const tokenExtractor = (req, res, next) => {
  const authorization = req.get('authorization')
  if (authorization && authorization.toLowerCase().startsWith('bearer ')) {
    try {
      req.decodedToken = jwt.verify(authorization.substring(7), SECRET)
    } catch{
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'token invalid' })
    }
  } else {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'token missing' })
  }
  next()
}

module.exports = { tokenExtractor }
```

An admin can now re-enable the user <i>jakousa</i> by making a PUT request to _/api/users/jakousa_, where the request comes with the following data:

```js
{
    "disabled": false
}
```

As noted in [the end of Part 4](/en/part4/token_authentication#problems-of-token-based-authentication), the way we implement disabling users here is problematic. Whether or not the user is disabled is only checked at _login_, if the user has a token at the time the user is disabled, the user may continue to use the same token, since no lifetime has been set for the token and the disabled status of the user is not checked when creating notes.

Before we proceed, let's make an npm script for the application, which allows us to undo the previous migration. After all, not everything always goes right the first time when developing migrations.

Let's modify the file <i>util/db.js</i> as follows:

```js
const Sequelize = require('sequelize')
const { DATABASE_URL } = require('./config')
const { Umzug, SequelizeStorage } = require('umzug')

const sequelize = new Sequelize(DATABASE_URL, {
  dialectOptions: {
    ssl: {
      require: true,
      rejectUnauthorized: false
    }
  },
});

const connectToDatabase = async () => {
  try {
    await sequelize.authenticate()
    await runMigrations()
    console.log('connected to the database')
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('failed to connect to the database')
    return process.exit(1)
  }

  return null
}

// highlight-start
const migrationConf = {
  migrations: {
    glob: 'migrations/*.js',
  },
  storage: new SequelizeStorage({ sequelize, tableName: 'migrations' }),
  context: sequelize.getQueryInterface(),
  logger: console,
}
  
const runMigrations = async () => {
  const migrator = new Umzug(migrationConf)
  const migrations = await migrator.up()
  console.log('Migrations up to date', {
    files: migrations.map((mig) => mig.name),
  })
}

const rollbackMigration = async () => {
  await sequelize.authenticate()
  const migrator = new Umzug(migrationConf)
  await migrator.down()
}
// highlight-end

/* highlight-start */
module.exports = { connectToDatabase, sequelize, rollbackMigration }
/* highlight-end */
```

Let's create a file <i>util/rollback.js</i>, which will allow the npm script to execute the specified migration rollback function:

```js
const { rollbackMigration } = require('./db')

rollbackMigration()
```

and the script itself:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "migration:down": "node util/rollback.js" // highlight-line
  },
}
```

So we can now undo the previous migration by running _npm run migration:down_ from the command line.

Migrations are currently executed automatically when the program is started. In the development phase of the program, it might sometimes be more appropriate to disable the automatic execution of migrations and make migrations manually from the command line.

The current code for the application is in its entirety on [GitHub](https://github.com/fullstack-hy/part13-notes/tree/part13-7), branch <i>part13-7</i>.

### Exercises 13.17-13.18.

#### Exercise 13.17.

Delete all tables from your application's database.

Make a migration that initializes the database. Add <i>created\_at</i> and <i>updated\_at</i> [timestamps](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#timestamps) for both tables. Keep in mind that you will have to add them in the migration yourself.

**NOTE:** be sure to remove the commands <i>User.sync()</i> and <i>Blog.sync()</i>, which synchronizes the models' schemas from your code, otherwise your migrations will fail.

**NOTE2:** if you have to delete tables from the command line (i.e. you don't do the deletion by undoing the migration), you will have to delete the contents of the <i>migrations</i> table if you want your program to perform the migrations again.

#### Exercise 13.18.

Expand your application (by migration) so that the blogs have a year written attribute, i.e. a field <i>year</i> which is an integer at least equal to 1991 but not greater than the current year. Make sure the application gives an appropriate error message if an incorrect value is attempted to be given for a year written.

</div>

<div class="content">

### Many-to-many relationships

We will continue to expand the application so that each user can be added to one or more <i>teams</i>.

Since an arbitrary number of users can join one team, and one user can join an arbitrary number of teams, we are dealing with a [many-to-many](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html#many-to-many-relationships) relationship, which is traditionally implemented in relational databases using a <i>connection table</i>.

Let's now create the code needed for the teams table as well as the connection table. The migration (saved in file <i>20211209\_02\_add\_teams\_and\_memberships.js</i>) is as follows:

```js
const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize')

module.exports = {
  up: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('teams', {
      id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        primaryKey: true,
        autoIncrement: true
      },
      name: {
        type: DataTypes.TEXT,
        allowNull: false,
        unique: true
      },
    })
    await queryInterface.createTable('memberships', {
      id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        primaryKey: true,
        autoIncrement: true
      },
      user_id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        allowNull: false,
        references: { model: 'users', key: 'id' },
      },
      team_id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        allowNull: false,
        references: { model: 'teams', key: 'id' },
      },
    })
  },
  down: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('teams')
    await queryInterface.dropTable('memberships')
  },
}
```

The models contain almost the same code as the migration. The team model in <i>models/team.js</i>:

```js
const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize')

const { sequelize } = require('../util/db')

class Team extends Model {}

Team.init({
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true
  },
  name: {
    type: DataTypes.TEXT,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true
  },
}, {
  sequelize,
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false,
  modelName: 'team'
})

module.exports = Team
```

The model for the connection table in <i>models/membership.js</i>:

```js
const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize')

const { sequelize } = require('../util/db')

class Membership extends Model {}

Membership.init({
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true
  },
  userId: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    references: { model: 'users', key: 'id' },
  },
  teamId: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    references: { model: 'teams', key: 'id' },
  },
}, {
  sequelize,
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false,
  modelName: 'membership'
})

module.exports = Membership
```

So we have given the connection table a name that describes it well, <i>membership</i>. There is not always a relevant name for a connection table, in which case the name of the connection table can be a combination of the names of the tables that are joined, e.g. <i>user\_teams</i> could fit our situation.

We make a small addition to the <i>models/index.js</i> file to connect teams and users at the code level using the [belongsToMany](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html#implementation-3) method.

```js
const Note = require('./note')
const User = require('./user')
// highlight-start
const Team = require('./team')
const Membership = require('./membership')
// highlight-end

Note.belongsTo(User)
User.hasMany(Note)

// highlight-start
User.belongsToMany(Team, { through: Membership })
Team.belongsToMany(User, { through: Membership })
// highlight-end

module.exports = {
  Note, User, Team, Membership // highlight-line
}

```

Note the difference between the migration of the connection table and the model when defining foreign key fields. During the migration, fields are defined in snake case form:

```js
await queryInterface.createTable('memberships', {
  // ...
  user_id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    references: { model: 'users', key: 'id' },
  },
  team_id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    references: { model: 'teams', key: 'id' },
  }
})
```

in the model, the same fields are defined in camel case:

```js
Membership.init({
  // ...
  userId: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    references: { model: 'users', key: 'id' },
  },
  teamId: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    references: { model: 'teams', key: 'id' },
  },
  // ...
})
```

Now let's create a couple of teams from the psql console, as well as a few memberships:

```js
insert into teams (name) values ('toska');
insert into teams (name) values ('mosa climbers');
insert into memberships (user_id, team_id) values (1, 1);
insert into memberships (user_id, team_id) values (1, 2);
insert into memberships (user_id, team_id) values (2, 1);
insert into memberships (user_id, team_id) values (3, 2);
```

Information about users' teams is then added to route for retrieving all users

```js
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.findAll({
    include: [
      {
        model: Note,
        attributes: { exclude: ['userId'] }
      },
      // highlight-start
      {
        model: Team,
        attributes: ['name', 'id'],
      }
      // highlight-end
    ]
  })
  res.json(users)
})
```

The most observant will notice that the query printed to the console now combines three tables.

The solution is pretty good, but there's a beautiful flaw in it. The result also comes with the attributes of the corresponding row of the connection table, although we do not want this:

![](../../images/13/3.png)


By carefully reading the documentation, you can find a [solution](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/advanced-many-to-many.html#specifying-attributes-from-the-through-table):

```js
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.findAll({
    include: [
      {
        model: Note,
        attributes: { exclude: ['userId'] }
      },
      {
        model: Team,
        attributes: ['name', 'id'],
        // highlight-start
        through: {
          attributes: []
        }
      // highlight-end
      }
    ]
  })
  res.json(users)
})
```

The current code for the application is in its entirety on [GitHub](https://github.com/fullstack-hy/part13-notes/tree/part13-8), branch <i>part13-8</i>.

### Note on the properties of Sequelize model objects

The specification of our models is shown by the following lines:

```js
User.hasMany(Note)
Note.belongsTo(User)

User.belongsToMany(Team, { through: Membership })
Team.belongsToMany(User, { through: Membership })
```

These allow Sequelize to make queries that retrieve, for example, all the notes of users, or all members of a team.

Thanks to the definitions, we also have direct access to, for example, the user's notes in the code. In the following code, we will search for a user with id 1 and print the notes associated with the user:

```js
const user = await User.findByPk(1, {
  include: {
    model: Note
  }
})

user.notes.forEach(note => {
  console.log(note.content)
})
```

The <i>User.hasMany(Note)</i> definition therefore attaches a <i>notes</i> property to the <i>user</i> object, which gives access to the notes made by the user. The <i>User.belongsToMany(Team, { through: Membership }))</i> definition similarly attaches a <i>teams</i> property to the <i>user</i> object, which can also be used in the code:

```js
const user = await User.findByPk(1, {
  include: {
    model: team
  }
})

user.teams.forEach(team => {
  console.log(team.name)
})
```

Suppose we would like to return a JSON object from the single user's route containing the user's name, username and number of notes created. We could try the following:

```js
router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id, {
    include: {
        model: Note
      }
    }
  )

  if (user) {
    user.note_count = user.notes.length // highlight-line
    delete user.notes // highlight-line
    res.json(user)

  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```

So, we tried to add the <i>noteCount</i> field on the object returned by Sequelize and remove the <i>notes</i> field from it. However, this approach does not work, as the objects returned by Sequelize are not normal objects where the addition of new fields works as we intend.

A better solution is to create a completely new object based on the data retrieved from the database:

```js
router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id, {
    include: {
        model: Note
      }
    }
  )

  if (user) {
    res.json({
      username: user.username, // highlight-line
      name: user.name, // highlight-line
      note_count: user.notes.length // highlight-line
    })

  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```
### Revisiting many-to-many relationships

Let's make another many-to-many relationship in the application. Each note is associated to the user who created it by a foreign key. It is now decided that the application also supports that the note can be associated with other users, and that a user can be associated with an arbitrary number of notes created by other users. The idea is that these notes are those that the user has <i>marked</i> for himself.

Let's make a connection table <i>user\_notes</i> for the situation. The migration, that is saved in file <i>20211209\_03\_add\_user\_notes.js</i> is straightforward:

```js
const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize')

module.exports = {
  up: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('user_notes', {
      id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        primaryKey: true,
        autoIncrement: true
      },
      user_id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        allowNull: false,
        references: { model: 'users', key: 'id' },
      },
      note_id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        allowNull: false,
        references: { model: 'notes', key: 'id' },
      },
    })
  },
  down: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('user_notes')
  },
}
```

Also, there is nothing special about the model:

```js
const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize')

const { sequelize } = require('../util/db')

class UserNotes extends Model {}

UserNotes.init({
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true
  },
  userId: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    references: { model: 'users', key: 'id' },
  },
  noteId: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    allowNull: false,
    references: { model: 'notes', key: 'id' },
  },
}, {
  sequelize,
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false,
  modelName: 'user_notes'
})

module.exports = UserNotes
```

The file <i>models/index.js</i>, on the other hand, comes with a slight change to what we saw before:

```js
const Note = require('./note')
const User = require('./user')
const Team = require('./team')
const Membership = require('./membership')
const UserNotes = require('./user_notes') // highlight-line

Note.belongsTo(User)
User.hasMany(Note)

User.belongsToMany(Team, { through: Membership })
Team.belongsToMany(User, { through: Membership })

// highlight-start
User.belongsToMany(Note, { through: UserNotes, as: 'marked_notes' })
Note.belongsToMany(User, { through: UserNotes, as: 'users_marked' })
// highlight-end

module.exports = {
  Note, User, Team, Membership, UserNotes
}
```

Once again <i>belongsToMany</i> is used, which now links users to notes via the <i>UserNotes</i> model corresponding to the connection table. However, this time we give an <i>alias name</i> for the attribute formed using the keyword [as](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/advanced-many-to-many.html#aliases-and-custom-key-names), the default name (a user's <i>notes</i>) would overlap with its previous meaning, i.e. notes created by the user.

We extend the route for an individual user to return the user's teams, their own notes, and other notes marked by the user:

```js
router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id, {
    attributes: { exclude: [''] } ,
    include:[{
        model: Note,
        attributes: { exclude: ['userId'] }
      },
      {
        model: Note,
        as: 'marked_notes',
        attributes: { exclude: ['userId']},
        through: {
          attributes: []
        }
      },
      {
        model: Team,
        attributes: ['name', 'id'],
        through: {
          attributes: []
        }
      },
    ]
  })

  if (user) {
    res.json(user)
  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```

In the context of the include, we must now use the alias name <i>marked\_notes</i> which we have just defined with the <i>as</i> attribute.

In order to test the feature, let's create some test data in the database:

```sql
insert into user_notes (user_id, note_id) values (1, 4);
insert into user_notes (user_id, note_id) values (1, 5);
```

The end result is functional:

![](../../images/13/5a.png)

What if we wanted to include information about the author of the note in the notes marked by the user as well? This can be done by adding an <i>include</i> to the marked notes:

```js
router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id, {
    attributes: { exclude: [''] } ,
    include:[{
        model: Note,
        attributes: { exclude: ['userId'] }
      },
      {
        model: Note,
        as: 'marked_notes',
        attributes: { exclude: ['userId']},
        through: {
          attributes: []
        },
        // highlight-start
        include: {
          model: User,
          attributes: ['name']
        }
        // highlight-end
      },
      {
        model: Team,
        attributes: ['name', 'id'],
        through: {
          attributes: []
        }
      },
    ]
  })

  if (user) {
    res.json(user)
  } else {
    res.status(404).end()
  }
})
```


The end result is as desired:

### Exercises 13.19.-13.23.

#### Exercise 13.19.

Give users the ability to add blogs on the system to a <i>reading list</i>. When added to the reading list, the blog should be in the <i>unread</i> state. The blog can later be marked as <i>read</i>. Implement the reading list using a connection table. Make database changes using migrations.

In this task, adding to a reading list and displaying the list need not be successful other than directly using the database.

#### Exercise 13.20.

Now add functionality to the application to support the reading list.

Adding a blog to the reading list is done by making an HTTP POST to the path <i>/api/readinglists</i>, the request will be accompanied with the blog and user id:

```js
{
  "blogId": 10,
  "userId": 3
}
```

Also modify the individual user route _GET /api/users/:id_ to return not only the user's other information but also the reading list, e.g. in the following format:

```js
{
  name: "Matti Luukkainen",
  username: "mluukkai@iki.fi",
  readings: [
    {
      id: 3,
      url: "https://google.com",
      title: "Clean React",
      author: "Dan Abramov",
      likes: 34,
      year: null,
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      url: "https://google.com",
      title: "Clean Code",
      author: "Bob Martin",
      likes: 5,
      year: null,
    }
  ]
}
```

At this point, information about whether the blog is read or not does not need to be available.

#### Exercise 13.21.

Expand the single-user route so that each blog in the reading list shows also whether the blog has been read <i>and</i> the id of the corresponding join table row.

For example, the information could be in the following form:

```js
{
  name: "Matti Luukkainen",
  username: "mluukkai@iki.fi",
  readings: [
    {
      id: 3,
      url: "https://google.com",
      title: "Clean React",
      author: "Dan Abramov",
      likes: 34,
      year: null,
      readinglists: [
        {
          read: false,
          id: 2
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      url: "https://google.com",
      title: "Clean Code",
      author: "Bob Martin",
      likes: 5,
      year: null,
      readinglists: [
        {
          read: false,
          id: 3
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: there are several ways to implement this functionality. [This](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/advanced-many-to-many.html#the-best-of-both-worlds--the-super-many-to-many-relationship) should help.

Note also that despite having an array field <i>readinglists</i> in the example, it should always just contain exactly one object, the join table entry that connects the book to the particular user's reading list.

#### Exercise 13.22.

Implement functionality in the application to mark a blog in the reading list as read. Marking as read is done by making a request to the _PUT /api/readinglists/:id_ path, and sending the request with

```js
{ "read": true }
```

The user can only mark the blogs in their own reading list as read. The user is identified as usual from the token accompanying the request.

#### Exercise 13.23.

Modify the route that returns a single user's information so that the request can control which of the blogs in the reading list are returned:

- _GET /api/users/:id_ returns the entire reading list
- _GET /api/users/:id?read=true_ returns blogs that have been read
- _GET /api/users/:id?read=false_ returns blogs that have not been read

### Concluding remarks

The state of our application is starting to be at least acceptable. However, before the end of the section, let's look at a few more points.

#### Eager vs lazy fetch

When we make queries using the <i>include</i> attribute:

```js
User.findOne({
  include: {
    model: note
  }
})
```

The so-called [eager fetch](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html#basics-of-queries-involving-associations) occurs, i.e. all the rows of the tables attached to the user by the join query, in the example the notes made by the user, are fetched from the database at the same time. This is often what we want, but there are also situations where you want to do a so-called _lazy fetch_, e.g. search for user related teams only if they are needed.

Let's now modify the route for an individual user so that it fetches the user's teams only if the query parameter <i>teams</i> is set in the request:

```js
router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id, {
    attributes: { exclude: [''] } ,
    include:[{
        model: note,
        attributes: { exclude: ['userId'] }
      },
      {
        model: Note,
        as: 'marked_notes',
        attributes: { exclude: ['userId']},
        through: {
          attributes: []
        },
        include: {
          model: user,
          attributes: ['name']
        }
      },
    ]
  })

  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).end()
  }

  // highlight-start
  let teams = undefined

  if (req.query.teams) {
    teams = await user.getTeams({
      attributes: ['name'],
      joinTableAttributes: []  
    })
  }

  res.json({ ...user.toJSON(), teams })
  // highlight-end
})
```

So now, the <i>User.findByPk</i> query does not retrieve teams, but they are retrieved if necessary by the <i>user</i> method <i>getTeams</i>, which is automatically generated by Sequelize for the model object. Similar <i>get</i>- and a few other useful methods [are automatically generated](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html#special-methodsmixins-added-to-instances) when defining associations for tables at the Sequelize level.

#### Features of models

There are some situations where, by default, we do not want to handle all the rows of a particular table. One such case could be that we don't normally want to display users that have been <i>disabled</i> in our application. In such a situation, we could define the default [scopes](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/scopes.html) for the model like this:

```js
class User extends Model {}

User.init({
  // field definition
}, {
  sequelize,
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false,
  modelName: 'user',
  // highlight-start
  defaultScope: {
    where: {
      disabled: false
    }
  },
  scopes: {
    admin: {
      where: {
        admin: true
      }
    },
    disabled: {
      where: {
        disabled: true
      }
    }
  }
  // highlight-end
})

module.exports = User
```

Now the query caused by the function call <i>User.findAll()</i> has the following WHERE condition:

```
WHERE "user". "disabled" = false;
```

For models, it is possible to define other scopes as well:

```js
User.init({
  // field definition
}, {
  sequelize,
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false,
  modelName: 'user',
  defaultScope: {
    where: {
      disabled: false
    }
  },
    // highlight-start
  scopes: {
    admin: {
      where: {
        admin: true
      }
    },
    disabled: {
      where: {
        disabled: true
      }
    },
    name(value) {
      return {
        where: {
          name: {
            [Op.iLike]: value
          }
        }
      }
    },
  }
  // highlight-end
})
```

Scopes are used as follows:

```js
// all admins
const adminUsers = await User.scope('admin').findAll()

// all inactive users
const disabledUsers = await User.scope('disabled').findAll()

// users with the string jami in their name
const jamiUsers = await User.scope({ method: ['name', '%jami%'] }).findAll()
```

It is also possible to chain scopes:

```js
// admins with the string jami in their name
const jamiUsers = await User.scope('admin', { method: ['name', '%jami%'] }).findAll()
```

Since Sequelize models are normal [JavaScript classes](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#taking-advantage-of-models-being-classes), it is possible to add new methods to them.

Here are two examples:

```js
const { Model, DataTypes, Op } = require('sequelize') // highlight-line

const Note = require('./note')
const { sequelize } = require('../util/db')

class User extends Model {
  // highlight-start
  async number_of_notes() {
    return (await this.getNotes()).length
  }

  static async with_notes(limit){
    return await User.findAll({
      attributes: {
        include: [[ sequelize.fn("COUNT", sequelize.col("notes.id")), "note_count" ]]
      },
      include: [
        {
          model: Note,
          attributes: []
        },
      ],
      group: ['user.id'],
      having: sequelize.literal(`COUNT(notes.id) > ${limit}`)
    })
  }
  // highlight-end
}

User.init({
  // ...
})

module.exports = User
```

The first of the methods <i>numberOfNotes</i> is an <i>instance method</i>, meaning that it can be called on instances of the model:

```js
const jami = await User.findOne({ name: 'Jami Kousa'})
const cnt = await jami.number_of_notes()
console.log(`Jami has created ${cnt} notes`)
```

Within the instance method, the keyword <i>this</i> therefore refers to the instance itself:

```js
async number_of_notes() {
  return (await this.getNotes()).length
}
```

The second of the methods, which returns those users who have at least <i>X</i>, the number specified by the parameter, amount of notes is a <i>class method</i>, i.e. it is called directly on the model:

```js
const users = await User.with_notes(2)
console.log(JSON.stringify(users, null, 2))
users.forEach(u => {
  console.log(u.name)
})
```

#### Repeatability of models and migrations

We have noticed that the code for models and migrations is very repetitive. For example, the model of teams

```js
class Team extends Model {}

Team.init({
  id: {
    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true,
    autoIncrement: true
  },
  name: {
    type: DataTypes.TEXT,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true
  },
}, {
  sequelize,
  underscored: true,
  timestamps: false,
  modelName: 'team'
})

module.exports = Team
```

and migration contain much of the same code

```js
const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize')

module.exports = {
  up: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('teams', {
      id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        primaryKey: true,
        autoIncrement: true
      },
      name: {
        type: DataTypes.TEXT,
        allowNull: false,
        unique: true
      },
    })
  },
  down: async ({ context: queryInterface }) => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('teams')
  },
}
```

Couldn't we optimize the code so that, for example, the model exports the shared parts needed for the migration?

However, the problem is that the definition of the model may change over time, for example the <i>name</i> field may change or its data type may change. Migrations must be able to be performed successfully at any time from start to end, and if the migrations are relying on the model to have certain content, it may no longer be true in a month or a year's time. Therefore, despite the "copy paste", the migration code should be completely separate from the model code.

One solution would be to use Sequelize's [command line tool](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html#creating-the-first-model--and-migration-), which generates both models and migration files based on commands given at the command line. For example, the following command would create a <i>User</i> model with <i>name</i>, <i>username</i>, and <i>admin</i> as attributes, as well as the migration that manages the creation of the database table:  

```
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes name:string,username:string,admin:boolean
```

From the command line, you can also run rollbacks, i.e. undo migrations. The command line documentation is unfortunately incomplete and in this course we decided to do both models and migrations manually. The solution may or may not have been a wise one.

### Exercise 13.24.

#### Exercise 13.24.

Grand finale: [towards the end of part 4](/en/part4/token_authentication#problems-of-token-based-authentication) there was mention of a token-criticality problem: if a user's access to the system is decided to be revoked, the user may still use the token in possession to use the system.

The usual solution to this is to store a record of each token issued to the client in the backend database, and to check with each request whether access is still valid. In this case, the validity of the token can be removed immediately if necessary. Such a solution is often referred to as a <i>server-side session</i>.

Now expand the system so that the user who has lost access will not be able to perform any actions that require login.

You will probably need at least the following for the implementation
- a boolean value column in the user table to indicate whether the user is disabled
  - it is sufficient to disable and enable users directly from the database
- a table that stores active sessions
  - a session is stored in the table when a user logs in, i.e. operation _POST /api/login_
  - the existence (and validity) of the session is always checked when the user makes an operation that requires login
- a route that allows the user to "log out" of the system, i.e. to practically remove active sessions from the database, the route can be e.g. _DELETE /api/logout_

Keep in mind that actions requiring login should not be successful with an "expired token", i.e. with the same token after logging out.

You may also choose to use some purpose-built npm library to handle sessions.

Make the database changes required for this task using migrations.
