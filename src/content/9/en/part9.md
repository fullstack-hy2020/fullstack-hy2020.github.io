This part is all about TypeScript: and open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript.

In this part we will be using the tools previously intrudeced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem with linters predefined and an existing codebase writing TypeScript. After doing this part you should be able to understand, develop and configure projects using TypeScript.

This part is created by the awesome developers of [Terveystalo](https://www.terveystalo.com/fi/Yritystietoa/Terveystalo-tyontantajana/Digital-Health/) the leading... yolo
