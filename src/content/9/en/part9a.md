## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language created by Microsoft, and is designed for the development of large JavaScript applications. For instance Microsoft has written both the _Azure Management Portal_ (1,2 million lines of code) and the _Visual Studio Code_ (300 000 lines of code) applications using TypeScript. As support for building large-scale JavaScript applications, TypeScript offers e.g. better development-time tooling, static code analysis, compile-time type checking and code level documentation.

### Main principle

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, which eventually gets compiled into plain JavaScript code. And the programmer is even able to decide the version of the generated code, as long as it's ECMAScript 3 or newer. That TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript means that it includes all the features of JavaScript and additional features moreover. In fact, all existing JavaScript code is actually valid TypeScript.

TypeScript consists of three separate, but mutually fulfilling parts:

- The language
- The compiler
- The language Service

**The language** is made up of a slightly different syntax (compared to JavaScript), keywords and type annotations. Of the listed three things, the language is the one that the programmer is in most direct contact with.

**The compiler** is responsible for type information erasure and the code transformations, that enable TypeScript code to be transpiled into executable JavaScript-code. In other words, TypeScript isn't actually genuine statically typed code, because everything related to the types is removed at compile-time.
Traditionally _compiling_ means that code is transformed from a human readable format to a machine readable format. In TypeScript's case the human readable source code is transformed into another human readable source code, so the correct term to be used should be _transpiling_, but compiling has risen to the most commonly known term in this context, so we will continue using the same term.
The compiler also performs a static code analysis, so it can emit warnings or errors if it finds a reason for it. Furthermore, the compiler can be set to perform additional tasks, such as combining the generated code into a single file.

**The language service** collects type information from the source code in such a format, that development tools can utilize it for providing intellisense, type hints and possible refactoring alternatives.

### TypeScript key language features

Here are described some of the key features of the TypeScript language. This description is intended to provide you with some basic knowledge, that will help you understand more of what is to come during this course.

#### Type annotations

Type annotations in TypeScript are lightweight ways to record the intended contract of a function or a variable. In the example below we have defined, that the `birthdayGreeter` function will accept one argument of type string and one of type number. We have also defined that the function will return a string.

```js
const birthdayGreeter = (name: string, age: number): string => {
  return `Happy birthday ${name}, you are now ${age} years old!`;
};

const birthdayHero = "Jane User";
const age = 22;

document.body.textContent = birthdayGreeter(birthdayHero, 22);
```

#### Structural typing

TypeScript is a structurally typed language. In structural typing, an element is considered to be compatible with another if for each feature within the second element's type, a corresponding and identical feature exists in the first element's type. Two types are considered to be identical if both are compatible with each other.

#### Type inference

In TypeScript, the compiler can attempt to infer the type information if no explicit type has been specified. The inference is done based on the assigned value and it's usage.
The type inference takes place when initializing variables and members, setting parameter default values, and determining function return types.

Below is an example of how type inference in TypeScript is done in a gradually more indirect way.

First the `add` function's return value is inferred by retracing the code back to the function's return expression. The return expression performs an addition of two numbers, which can be seen from the types of the function's parameters. Thus, the return type `number` is inferred in this case.

Next an interface called `CallsFunction` is declared. The interface consists of a function with one parameter `cb`, which in turn is a callback function accepting a string parameter and returns _any_ value. The function `callsFunction` is set to be of type `CallsFunction`, so in the function it can be inferred that the callback function will only accept a string argument. To demonstrate this, there is also an example where the callback function is called with a numeric value, which causes an error in TypeScript.

Lastly, when `callsFunction` is called, we pass it an anonymous function and TypeScript can, based on the type of `callsFunction`, infer that the call will return a string.

```js
const add = (a: number, b: number) => {
  /* The return value is used to determine
     the return type of the function */
  return a + b;
}

interface CallsFunction {
  (cb: (result: string) => any): void;
}

// The cb parameter is inferred to be a function accepting a string
const callsFunction: CallsFunction = (cb) => {
  cb('Done');
  
  // Error: Argument of type '1' is not assignable to parameter of type string
  cb(1);
}

// The result parameter is inferred to be a string
callsFunction((result) => {
  return result;
});
```

#### Type erasure

TypeScript removes type annotations, interfaces, type aliases, and other type system constructs during compilation.

Input:

```js
let x: SomeInterface;
```

Output:

```js
let x;
```

This means that at runtime, there is no information present that says that some variable x was declared as being of type SomeInterface.

The lack of runtime type information can be surprising for programmers who are used to extensively using reflection or other metadata systems.

### Why should one use TypeScript?

You may stumble upon a lot of different arguments either for or against TypeScript on different forums. The truth probably is as vague as: it depends on your need and use of the functions, which TypeScript offers. Nevertheless, here are explained some of the reasoning why the use of TypeScript may have some advantages.

First of all, probably the most noticable feature with TypeScript is that it offers **type checking and static code analysis**. The ability to require values to be of a certain type and to have the compiler warn about wrongful usage of the values can help reduce runtime errors and you might even be able to reduce the amount of required unit tests in a project, at least concerning pure type tests. The static code analysis doesn't only warn about wrongful type usage, but also if you for instance misspell a variable or function name or try to use a value beyond it's scope etc. With the help of sufficient linter settings, it's difficult to produce runtime errors.

_There are some exceptions though; if you use the type `any` or process external input in some way, then it's still possible to produce runtime errors. Therefore, TypeScript isn't a silver bullet!_

The second advantage with TypeScript is that the type annotations in the code can function as a type of **code level documentation**. It's easy to check from a function signature what kind of arguments the function can consume and what type of data it will produce. This type of "type annotation bound documentation" will always be up to date, which makes it easier for new programmers to start working on an existing project. Moreover, this type of documentation is also helpful when returning to earlier written code. Types may also be re-used all around the code base, so a change to one type automatically reflects as a change to all the locations where the type is used. One might argue that you can achieve similar code level documentation with e.g. [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html), but, the more verbose JSDoc is not connected to the code as tightly as TypeScript's types, and may thus get out of sync more easily.

The third advantage with TypeScript is the more **specific and smarter intellisense**, which the IDEs can provide when they know exactly what types of data you are processing.

When put together, all of the advantages above are extremely helpful when you have a need to refactor your code. The static code analysis emits warnings if you have any errors in your code and the intellisense can provide you hints about available properties and even possible refactoring options. The code level documentation helps you understand the existing code, and with the help of TypeScript it is also very easy to start using the newest JavaScript language features at an early stage, by just altering the configuration.

### What does TypeScript not fix?

As mentioned before, TypeScript type annotations and type checking only exist at compile time and no longer at runtime. Thus, even if the compiler does not give any errors, runtime errors are still possible. Especially when handling external input or if you use the dynamic type `any` in your code.

Lastly, here are a few examples of what many regard as downsides with TypeScript, which might be good to be aware of:

#### Incomplete, invalid or missing types in external libraries

When using external libraries you may find that some libraries have either missing or in some way invalid type declarations. Most often the reason behind this is that the library has not been made with TypeScript and the types are required to be declared manually, or someone has already done that, but hasn't done such a good job with it. These are occasions where you may need to define the type declarations of the library yourself. However, you should first check out [DefinitelyTyped](https://definitelytyped.org/) or [their GitHub pages](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped), which are probably the most used sources for type declaration files and there is a good chance someone has already added typings for the package you are using. Otherwise you might want to start off by getting acquainted with TypeScript's own [documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) regarding type declarations.

#### Sometimes type inference needs assistance

The type inference in TypeScript is pretty good, but not perfect. Sometimes you may feel like you have declared your types perfectly, but the compiler still tells you that "the property does not exist" or that "that kind of usage is not allowed". These are occasions when you may need to help the compiler with doing e.g. an "extra" type check or something like that. But be careful with type casting and type guards, because in those cases you are practically giving your word to the compiler, that the value really is of the type that you declare. You might want to check out TypeScript's documentation regarding [Type Assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#type-assertions) and [Type Guards](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-guards-and-differentiating-types).

#### Mysterious type errors

The errors given by the type system may sometimes be quite hard to understand, especially if you use complex types. As a general guideline it is helpful to keep in mind that TypeScript error messages usually contain the most useful content at the end of the message. So when running into long confusing messages, start reading them from the end.
