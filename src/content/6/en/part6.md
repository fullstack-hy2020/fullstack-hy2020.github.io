<div class="intro">

So far, we have placed the application's state and state logic directly inside React components.
When applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React components.
In this part, we will introduce the Redux library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications.

We'll learn about the lightweight version of Redux directly supported by React, namely the React context and useRedux hook, as well as the React Query library that simplifies the server state management.
